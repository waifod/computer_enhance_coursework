# sim8086
Simulator of the Intel 8086 architecture produced while following Casey Muratori's ["Computer, Enhance!" course](https://computerenhance.com).

The source code was developed in Rust on a modern Linux-based operating system.

# Note about obtaining the course materials
The example programs in this repository are intended to be executed with access to the original "Computer, Enhance!" course materials. To facilitate this access, the `computer_enhance` directory is intended to be an unmodified reproduction of the course materials.
